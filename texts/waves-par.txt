The sun had not yet risen.  The sea was indistinguishable from the
sky, except that the sea was slightly creased as if a cloth had
wrinkles in it.  Gradually as the sky whitened a dark line lay on
the horizon dividing the sea from the sky and the grey cloth became
barred with thick strokes moving, one after another, beneath the
surface, following each other, pursuing each other, perpetually.

'I see a ring,' said Bernard, 'hanging above me.  It quivers and
hangs in a loop of light.'

'I see a slab of pale yellow,' said Susan, 'spreading away until it
meets a purple stripe.'

'I hear a sound,' said Rhoda, 'cheep, chirp; cheep chirp; going up
and down.'

'I see a globe,' said Neville, 'hanging down in a drop against the
enormous flanks of some hill.'

'I see a crimson tassel,' said Jinny, 'twisted with gold threads.'

'I hear something stamping,' said Louis.  'A great beast's foot is
chained.  It stamps, and stamps, and stamps.'

'Look at the spider's web on the corner of the balcony,' said
Bernard.  'It has beads of water on it, drops of white light.'

'I pass from house to house like the friars in the Middle Ages who
cozened the wives and girls with beads and ballads.  I am a
traveller, a pedlar, paying for my lodging with a ballad; I am an
indiscriminate, an easily pleased guest; often putting up in the
best room in a four-poster; then lying in a barn on a haystack.  I
don't mind the fleas and find no fault with silk either.  I am very
tolerant.
